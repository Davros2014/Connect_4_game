# Connect 4

A simple web-application, 2-player version of the classic game. Inspired by a retro 1980's look, and created using HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JS and jQuery, and with a little localstorage implemention to retain the high-scores. Mobile responsive. Spoiler alert - includes CSS animated messages of encouragement and some tasty, classic arcade tunes

##### Rules: In this game players take turns dropping their pieces into one of seven columns that have six rows of slots. The first player to get their pieces into four sequential slots in a row, wins.
