# Connect 4

A simple web-application version of the classic game. Inspired by a retro 1980's look, and created using HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JS and jQuery, with a little localstorage implemented to retain the high-scores. Spoiler alert - includes animated messages of encouragement and some tasty, classic arcade tunes
